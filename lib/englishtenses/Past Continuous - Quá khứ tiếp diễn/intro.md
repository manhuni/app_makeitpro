## ⏰ Dấu hiệu nhận biết

- at + giờ + thời quá khứ (at 9 PM last night)  
- when, while, as  
- all day/night yesterday  
- at that moment (ở thời điểm đó)

📌 **Ví dụ:**
- **While** I was sleeping, someone knocked on the door.  
- He was working **at 10 PM last night**.

## 🧠 Mẹo học nhanh

- **I/he/she/it** → was + V-ing  
- **You/we/they** → were + V-ing  
- Diễn tả hành động **đang xảy ra trong quá khứ**, nên không dùng để mô tả sự kiện ngắn, kết thúc nhanh.
