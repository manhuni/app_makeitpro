## 6. 💡 Tip

This sound often varies by **accent**:

- In **British English**: strong and clear /ɑː/
- In **American English**: sometimes merges with /ɒ/ or rhotic sounds, e.g., *car* → /kɑːr/

📌 Spelling patterns:
- **ar** → *car, start, park*
- **a** → *father, drama*
- **al** → *calm, palm, half*

🎧 Practice with recordings from both accents to build awareness.
